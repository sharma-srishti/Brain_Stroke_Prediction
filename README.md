# Brain_Stroke_Prediction
In this project I have applied various machine laerning algorithm to predict chances of brain stroke
I have compared accuracy of various machine learning model
Decision Tree   Accuracy=0.905
Random Forest   Accuracy=0.940
SVC             Accuracy=0.768
KNN             Accuracy=0.876
Logistic Regression        Accuracy=0.82
Naive Bayes Classifier     Accuracy=0.798


Hence,Random Forest Classifier has highest accuracy.
